**2. Post**

  - Looking through her posts, a image with a tag is found. The tag is the flag and also formatted like one.


### Part 2

**1. Caption**

  - When looking through the captions of her posts, it gets clear that her favourite place to visit is Budapest.

### Part 3

**1. Connect the dots**

  - Looking at her username we can see the number 76. When thinking about it, a lot of people use their birthday in their username and Tanja did so too. With this we have the day and the month. The only thing that is missing is the year and this we can get by doing the math because she states in her caption how old she is.
