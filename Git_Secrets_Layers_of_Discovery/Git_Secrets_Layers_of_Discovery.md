# Git_Secrets_Layers_of_Discovery

OSINT-Challenge where you have to get 4 flags. The challenge is split into four parts.
**Level**: Easy - Medium


## Challenge Overview:

The infamous PhantomCoder0916 has been hiding encrypted messages in their Git repository, PhantomCode. Your mission is to track down and uncover these secrets before they disappear forever. Each clue brings you closer to understanding what PhantomCoder0916 is up to. 

---

### Part 1 - Commit Message

A strange commit appeared in the PhantomCode repository. Rumors say it contains a secret message, but it's buried among countless fake commits. Can you find what PhantomCoder0916 was trying to communicate?.

- Hint 1: Search commit messages carefully—one of them hides the truth.


### Part 2 - Deleted File

A crucial file once existed in the repository but was mysteriously deleted. What was in it? Why did PhantomCoder0916 erase it? Your task is to retrieve what was lost before it's gone for good.

- Hint 1: Look through the commit history to find traces of the missing file.


### Part 3 - Git Tag

Not all secrets are erased—some are cleverly hidden in plain sight. PhantomCoder0916 has been marking important milestones in the repository, but one of these marks conceals something unusual. Can you find the hidden message?

- Hint 1: Examine the tags carefully. One of them contains a secret.

### Part 4 - Fake Account

Someone has been tampering with the repository—an unknown user who shouldn’t have access. But who is it? PhantomCoder0916 may have created a fake identity to cover their tracks. Find the imposter and expose their email address to uncover the final piece of the puzzle.

- Hint 1: Investigate the commit authors. One of them doesn’t belong.


## Technical guideline

### Git Repository

Everything needed for this challenge is already set up in the [PhantomCode](https://github.com/ghostcoder0916/PhantomCode.git) repository under PhantomCoer0916. The repository contains all embedded flags, including hidden commit messages, deleted files, Git tags, and a fake user identity. No additional setup is required—participants only need access to the repository to start uncovering the secrets.
