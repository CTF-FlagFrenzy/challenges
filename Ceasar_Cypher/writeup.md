It is basically a flag that was encrypted using the ceasar cypher, a simple algorythm often used in easy CTF challanges.  
The algorithm works by shifting all the letters by a few characters, making it unreadable. It can however easily be reverted and read by using a [online converter](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher).  
The flag is, as always in the format: FF{hashedFlag}
