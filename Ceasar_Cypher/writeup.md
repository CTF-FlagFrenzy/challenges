# Caesar Cipher Challenge

This challenge introduces participants to cryptography using a Caesar cipher.  

## Challenge Overview

The goal is to decode an encrypted string displayed on a webpage. The encryption uses a Caesar cipher, which shifts each letter in the text by a random number of positions. The challenge is to reverse this process and retrieve the original flag.

## How It Works

1. **Flag Generation**:  
   The flag is generated by combining a predefined challenge key (`CeaserusCipherusRichtigus`) with a team-specific key (`TEAMKEY`) from the environment variables. This combination is hashed using SHA-256 to produce the flag in the format `FF{hashedFlag}`.

2. **Encryption**:  
   The flag is encrypted using a Caesar cipher with a random shift between 1 and 25. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.

3. **Webpage Display**:  
   The encrypted flag is embedded in an HTML file and served via an Apache web server.

## Example Code

The Caesar cipher encryption is implemented as follows:
```python
def caesar_cipher(text, shift):
    encrypted_text = []
    for char in text:
        if char.isalpha():
            start = ord("A") if char.isupper() else ord("a")
            encrypted_char = chr((ord(char) - start + shift) % 26 + start)
            encrypted_text.append(encrypted_char)
        else:
            encrypted_text.append(char)
    return "".join(encrypted_text)
```

The encrypted flag is displayed on the webpage:
```html
<h1>Some weird text has been found: {encrypted_text}</h1>
```

## Solving the Challenge

To solve the challenge, participants can use a [Caesar cipher decoder](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher) to decrypt the text and retrieve the original flag.

## Flag Format

The flag is always in the format: `FF{hashedFlag}`.
