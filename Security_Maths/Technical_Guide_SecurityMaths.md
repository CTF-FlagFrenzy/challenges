# CTF Others Challenges | SecurityMaths | Technical Guide | Medium
SecurityMaths is a challenge that combines knowledge from mathematics, systems engineering and the analysis of GPS data. The idea is that GPS coordinates are divided into three parts and have to be put together. 

## Challenge Description
Prof. Schmidtâ€™s coordinates to his favourite holiday destination were stolen. Unfortunately, he separated them into three pieces (due to security policies :p) which makes finding them quite difficult. However, the thief left some hints about their locations. Now it's your turn to find them! 
- The student's favourite eating location
- This place is quite interesting, but sadly, experiments are rather rare
- "Das ist aber SCHADE!"

---

## Technical Guideline
This technical guideline explains all necessary steps in order to provide the SecurityMaths challenge which is part of the Others challenge category.

### Templates and Positioning
1. Print the templates that are located in the SecurityMaths folder.
2. Adapt description if locations are changed.
3. Place the three pieces according to the locations that are provided with the hints in the description. In this case:
   -  School cafeteria
   -  Physics laboratory
   -  Agreement with RAM (Student must communicate with RAM: "Das ist aber SCHADE!")

**HAVE FUN**
